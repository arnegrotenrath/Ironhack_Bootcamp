# Ironhack_Bootcamp Projects

# This repository contains 6 different mini Projects, all conducted during the Ironhack Data Analytics bootcamp.
The projects represent the progress during the first 6 weeks of the bootcamp. Each project reflects the main topic of the week it was conducted.
Since various amount of time ranging from one to three days was available to conduct each project and the number of contributors ranged from one
in the solo projects to three in the group projects, they differ in complexity.

Different Topics ranging from introduction to python, data cleaning using the pandas library or data visualization, mainly with Tableau are represented by the projects.
The are ordered chronologically.

1. Python - Escape Room

In this one-day solo project, the skills learned in the introduction to python are applied. A working example of an excape room game is modified to a more complex, prolonged version.

2. Pandas - Data Cleaning and Manipulation

In order to work with the Pandas library, a messy dataset containing information about shark attacks is cleaned and wrangled in order to enhance the readability of the dataset

3. Web scraping and API - Immoscout and Lieferando

The first group project of the Bootcamp as well as a duration of three days increases the complexity of this project. Multiple data sources, namely Lieferando via web scraping and Immoscout via
API are used to gather data on the number of restaurants per zip code. Those are compared with the real estate prices in order to find a possible correlation.
